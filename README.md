# Imageprocessing
## Character detection 

### Idea:
In a developing country (like in my country, Nepal), we don't know whether the public buses run or not in the pre-defined route. 
So, to solve this kind of situation if we were able to read the character from the tag which are attached to the public buses by capturing the image from a standby camera in the station (for example, CCTV) through which we process the image captured and send the data to the server within the time, the bus reaches the next stop. So that, with the personal smartphone, an individual will be able to detect the buses and manage our time via a web-based application.
